# Overview

## Business Use-Case

An engineering firm needs to audit and track public infrastructure for safety via drone arial footage. They have captured tens of thousands of images (eg. cracks in bridges) and have stored them within archives based on year and month.

As a Cloud Engineer you have been tasked to building a proof-of-concept where you can use GenAI to use natural language to retrieve an image from the archive.

You need to report back possible technical paths and technical considerations for this project.

## Considertions and Requirements

- All resources will be created in `ap-northeast-1` Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
- We'll be using GitHub Codespaces so we have a consistent developer enviroment 
- We are not using free-tier services but the cost should be under $1 USD for the duration of the workshop
- We'll be using the following repo: [https://github.com/ExamProCo/aws-storage-genai-workshop](https://github.com/ExamProCo/aws-storage-genai-workshop)
- We may need to rebuild the container for AWS CLI to be installed


> devcontainers doesn't always work on Codespaces and requires lengthly rebuild and then even still hangs.

## Technical Uncertainty

- Can we extract specific bytes from an S3 file and read them?
- Can we use Amazon Nova to generate mock images to vary our dataset?
- Can we annotate the images in structure json output using Amazon Nova?
- Can we extract a specific image file from a zip archive from s3 (without the need to download archive)
- Can we use Nova Titans to create embeddings for our vector search database?
- Can we deploy pgvector database via container on a t3.micro?
- Can we get Amazon Nova to generate our query to our vector database and return the results?

### Setup AWS Infrastructure

- We need the two subnets from the default VPC.
- We need to run this command in CloudShell:

```sh
aws ec2 describe-subnets \
--region ap-northeast-1 \
--filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region ap-northeast-1 --filters "Name=is-default,Values=true" --query 'Vpcs[0].VpcId' --output text)" --query 'Subnets[0:2].SubnetId' --output text | tr '\t' ','
```

1. Open CloudShell
2. Paste the AWS CLI command from above
3. Copy the Subnet IDS for the next step

<img src="./docs/assets/cloudshell.png" width="600px"></img>

Lets deploy the following AWS Infrastructure:
- AWS User with AWS Credentials
- S3 Bucket
- RDS Instance

Please click this button to deploy:

1. Write the name for the stack `GenAIStorageStack`
2. Paste in the SubnetIds from the previous step
3. Set the database password `Testing123!`
4. Enable extra permissions
5. Create stack (and wait 5 mins)

2. Click on `Codespaces`
3. Click on `Create codespace on main`

<img src="./docs/assets/launch_codespaces.png" width="600px"></img>

1. Create copy of `.env.example and name it `.env`
2. Update `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` (get the values from the Cloudformation Stack)

<img src="./docs/assets/set_env.png" width="600px"></img>


1. Install Ruby Libraries by running `bundle install`

```sh
cd /workspaces/aws-storage-genai-workshop 
bundle install
```

<img src="./docs/assets/bundle_install.png" width="600px"></img>

> To install nokogiri will takes 1-2 mins

1. Install AWS CLI

```sh
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "/tmp/awscliv2.zip" && \
cd /tmp && unzip awscliv2.zip && sudo ./aws/install && \
rm -rf awscliv2.zip aws/ && cd -
```

# Test S3 Range

## Technical Uncertainty

We want to determine if we can read part of a file without downloading the entire file.
Amazon S3 suggests you can use a RANGE Http Header to specific the byte range to download.

### Upload File

We will upload a file called `hello_world.txt` to our bucket.

The contents of this file is `こんにちは世界`.

```bash
./bin/upload_file
```

### Read Part Of File

We will specfic the byte range to only read `世界`.

```bash
./bin/read_range
```

<img src="./docs/assets/see_range.png" width="600px"></img>

# Prepare Dataset

## Generate Mock Images

If our dataset has missing image examples we can generate our own to help later test
the edge cases for our application.

We are using `Amazon Nova Canvas` to generate images.

```sh
./bin/generate
```

This will output a file to `010__prepare_dataset/outputs/images/`

<img src="./docs/assets/generated_image_1.png" width="600px"></img>

> Example of generated image using the following prompt: The image shows the eaves of a building with visible cracks, spalling, and missing components. The surface appears deteriorated, with signs of water damage and discoloration. The eaves are part of the building's exterior, and the defects are concentrated along the edge where the roof meets the wall.


## Annotate Images

We need to generate out annotation (metadata) information so we can search our iamgs.

We are using `Amazon Nova Pro` to to analyze the image.

The challenge is generated structured json output.
While this implementation of `./bin/annotate` works, there is a chance for 1,000 of runs it might fail and so more work need to put to catch edgecases.

```sh
./bin/annotate
```

Here is a example of annoation output: [annotate.json.example](./outputs/annotate.json.example)

> This will annotate our real images, not the mock ones. If we can to include the mock ones we need to copy them into the input directory

## Create Archive, Inventory File and Upload to S3

1. Zip our images to an archive
2. Read the zip file and create an inventory file with byte ranges for exact files
3. Upload the zip archive to our S3 bucket

```sh
./bin/upload
```

## Test Downloading Single Image from the Archive

This script will read the inventory file to get the byte range,
we will use the byte range to download the image from inside the archive.

We have to decompress the partial data to get to the final file.

```sh
./bin/download hk0155.jpg
```

## Create Embedding Data

We will use an embedding model to convert our annotation data int vector embeddings.
We'll generate out a SQL file to mass import our data into our database.

```sh
./bin/embedd
```

# Prepare Vector Database

## Install PSQL

In order to interact with our Postgres database we will need to install the postgres client

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql-client -y
```

## Load Data into Databaase 

- We will enable vector extension
- We will setup our tables

```sh
./bin/execute ./sql/setup.sql
```

- We will insert our database

```sh
./bin/execute ./sql/insert.sql
```
> ⚠️ This file is autogenerated with a timestamp so you'll need to autocomplete eg. ./bin/execute ./sql/insert-1751397185.sql 

- Will will create our indexes

```sh
./bin/execute ./sql/indexes.sql
```

These warnings is due to our low amount of data.
In our production use-case we need to have indexes.

```sh
psql:sql/indexes.sql:9: NOTICE:  ivfflat index created with little data
DETAIL:  This will cause low recall.
HINT:  Drop the index until the table has more data.
CREATE INDEX
psql:sql/indexes.sql:11: NOTICE:  ivfflat index created with little data
DETAIL:  This will cause low recall.
HINT:  Drop the index until the table has more data.
CREATE INDEX
```

# Agent Search

## Agent

Using the converse API and Amazon Bedrock Pro we can search against
our vector database.

Example queries:
```sh
./bin/agent "cracks in wall that are not a concern"
./bin/agent "severe structural cracks in concrete walls"
./bin/agent "building defects requiring immediate action"
./bin/agent "roof problems with water damage"
./bin/agent "moderate spalling on urban structures"
./bin/agent "all safety concerns in buildings"
```
